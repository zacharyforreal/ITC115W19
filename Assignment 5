//Write a method called printGPA that accepts a Scanner for the console as a parameter and calculates a student's grade point average. 
//The user will type a line of input containing the student's name, then a number that represents the number of scores, followed by that
//many integer scores. Here are two example dialogues:

//Enter a student record: Maria 5 72 91 84 89 78
//Marie's grade is 82.8

//Enter s student record: Jordan 4 86 71 62 90
//Jordan's grade is 77.25
